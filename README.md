# Robotframework Automated Test
I used Intellij IDEA to write the test.
To run the test you need:
Java 8 + Maven,
You can use this command  to run the test: mvn robotframework:run -Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=C:\projects\autotests\Ülesanne\chromedriver.exe
It all depends where is your chrome web driver.
